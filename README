submodule-hooks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use these, copy them to $GIT_DIR/hooks/ and make them executable.

* pre-commit -- Check whether any submodule is about to be updated
  with the commit. Ask the user for confirmation.

* post-merge -- Check if any submodule has been updated post git-merge
  or git-pull. If so, ask if user wants to run git-submodule update.

* post-checkout -- Check if any submodule has been updated in HEAD
  after a branch checkout. If so, ask if user wants to run
  git-submodule update.
